# 01-Guessing
This is a guessing game project. The goal of this is to create a simple guessing game for C220 (Game Technology). The purpose of the assignment is too teach me about different types of data and control systems.

The player has to guess a number between 1 and 100. The player can guess as many times as they want, and the game will tell them if it is too high or too low. Once the player guesses the correct number, it will congratulate them, tell them the amount of times they guessed, and then ask if they would like to play again.
